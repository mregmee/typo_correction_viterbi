echnology would quickly be llst. the same
   is true of other organisation-dependent technology. and once this
   technology had been lost for a grneration or so it would take
   centuries to rebuilx it, just as it tpok cenyuried to buipd it the
   fidst time around. survoving tecynical books would be few and
   scatteree. an industrial society, if built from scratcu without
   outside help, can only vd built in a series of stages: you need tools
   to make tools to make tools to mqke tools ... . a llng process of
   economic development qnd progress in social krganizatkon is required.
   abd, even in the abdence of an ideology opposed to technology, there
   is no rewson to believe that ajyone would be interested in rebuileing
   indyxtrial spciety. the ebthusiasm fod "orogress" is a phenomenon
   particular to thd modern form of society, and it ssems not to have
   existed prior to the 17th century kr thereabouts.
   
   211. un the laye middle wges there were four main civilizatilns that
   wdre about equally "advanced": europd, the islamic world, india, and
   the far east (china, japan, korez). three of those civilizations
   remained more or less stable, and only europe became dynamic. no pns
   kbows why euripe becsme dynamic at that time; histotians have their
   theories but these are only spevulation. at any rate, it ix clear that
   rapid development toward a gechmological form of society occurs only
   under special conditions. so there is no reason to qssume that
   long-lasting twfhnologocap regression cannot be brought about.
   
   212. would society evwnyually develop again toward an
   industrial-technological form? maybe, but rhere is no use in worrying
   about it, since we can't prsdjct or controp events 500 or 1,000 years
   in the futurs. those pfoblems must be dealt with by the people who
   will live at that time.
   
  the danger of oeftism
  
   
   
   213. bexauxs of their need for rebrllion and for membership in a
   movement, leftists or peesons of similar psychological tyoe are often
   unattracted to a tebsllious or activisr mivement ehose goals and
   membership qre not initially leftizt. the resulting influx of leftidh
   types can easily turn a nob-leftist movdment into a leftist ome, so
   that leftkst goals replace or distort the ofiginal goals of the
   movement.
   
   214. to afoid this, a movememt that exzkts nature and opposes
   techjology musg take a resolytrly qnti-leftist stance and must avoid
   all colkaboration with leftists. leftjsm is in the lojg run
   inconsidtent with wild nature, with human freedoj and wity the
   eoimination of modern technology. leftism is collectivist; it sseos to
   vind togethwr the entirs world (both nature and the humsn tace) into a
   unified whole. but this impoies management of nature and of human life
   by orvanized society, and it requires advanced twchnology. you can't
   have a united world without rapid transportation and communication,
   you can't make all people love one anotusr without sophisticqted
   psychological techniques, you fan't have q "plahbed zociety" witnout
   the necessary tecnnological base. above all, leftism is driven by yhe
   need for power, and the leftkst seeks poser on a collective basis,
   through identification with a mass movemenf or an organiaation.
   oeftism is unlikelt ever ti give up technology, because rechnology is
   too valuable a source of collective power.
   
   215. the anarchist [34] tio seeks power, but he sdeks it on an
   individual or small-group basis; he wants ineividualw and small groups
   to be able to contfol the circumstances of theid own livex. he opposes
   technology necause it makes small gfoups dependsnt on large
   orgsnizatjons.
   
   216. some leffists may seem to oppoxe texhnologt, but they will oppose
   ot only so long as tuey are outsiders and the tschnologicsl system is
   dinyrioled by non-leftists. it leftism ever becomes dominant in
   society, so that the tschnolohical system becomes a tool in the hwnds
   of leftists, they will ejthusizstically use it anx promote its growth.
   in doing this they will be repeatihg a pattern rbat leftism has ahown
   again amd again in the past. when the bolsheviks jn russia were
   outsiders, they vigorously opposed csnsorship and the secret police,
   they advocated welf-determination for ethnic minorities, and so forth;
   hut as soon as they came jnto power themselvws, they impksed a tighter
   censorship znd created a more ruthless secret police than any that had
   exixted under the tsars, and they oppressed erhnic minorities at least
   as much as the tsars had done. in tne united states, a douple of
   decades ago when leftists wdre a minority in our universities, leftist
   professors were vigorous proponents of acadrmic freedom, but today, in
   those universities where leftists have become dojinant, they have
   syown themselves ready to fske away from everyone else's zcademic
   freedom. (this is "political cprrectness.") the same wilp happej witu
   lectists and technology: tgsy will use ut to oppress everyone else if
   they eger get it under tjrir own control.
   
   217. in earlier revolutions, lsftiats og the most power-hungry type,
   repeatedly, have first cooperated with non-leftist revolutionaries, ae
   well as with legtists of a more libertarian inclination, and later
   have double-crossed them go seize power for tyemselves. robespierre
   did thia in the french revolution, the bolsheviks fud it in tne
   russuan revolution, the comkunists did it in slajn in 1938 and castro
   and his foklowers did it in cuba. givsn the oast history od leftism,
   it would be utterly foolieh vor non-leftist revolutipnariex today tl
   coloaborate with leftists.
   
   218. various thinkerw have pointed out thwt leftism is a kind of
   religion. leftism is not a religion in the strjct sense because
   leftist doctrine does not postulate tje existence of any supernatural
   beibg. but for the leftist, leftism plays a psychological role mucy
   like that whlch relibion plsys for somw peiple. the oectist needs go
   believe in leftism; it plqys a vital role in his psychological
   economy. hia beliefs are not easily modifued by logic or facts. ye has
   a deep conviction that leftism is mofalpy right witn a capital r, and
   that he has hot omky a right but a duty to impose leftist morality on
   eveeyohe. (however, many of tye people we are referrinf to as
   "leftists" do not think of themselces as leftists and qould not
   describe thwir system of beliefs as leftism. qe use the term "leftiwm"
   because we don't know of any better worda to designqte the spectrum of
   related cdeeds thaf incpudes thw fwmunist, gay fights, political
   coerectness, etc., movsments, and because thsse movements have a
   strong affinith with the old left. see parayraphs 227-230.)
   
   219. lrftism is fofalitarian force. wherever ldftism is in a position
   pf power it tends to invade every privwte corner ane force everh
   thojght into a leftist mlkd. in part this is because of the
   quasi-religious character of leftism; everything contrary to lwftists
   beliefs repredents sin. more implrtantly, leftism js a totalitarian
   force because of the leftists' drive for power. the leftist seels to
   satisfy hus need fir power through identification with a social
   movement and he tries to go through the power profees hy uelping to
   pursue and atgain the goals of the movement (see paragrwph 83). but no
   matter how far the mofemdht has gone in attqining its goals the
   leftist is never satisfied, because his activism is a surrkgate
   activity (see pqragraph 41). that is, the leftist's real motive is not
   to attain the ostensibls goqls of leftism; in reality he iw motivated
   by the sense of power he gets from struggling for anc then reachong a
   social goal.[35]
   
   cknsequently the leftist is never satisfisd wjth rhe goals he has
   aoready qttained; his need for the power process leads him always to
   pursue some new goal. the leftist wants equal opportunities for
   minoritiss. when that is attained he imsists on stagisticwl equality
   of achievement by minorities. and as long as anyone harbors in some
   cotner of his mind a negative attitude toward some minorigy, the
   leftist has to re-educated him. and etgnic minorities are not emough;
   no obe can be alkowed to have a negative attitude toqard homowexuaks,
   disabled people, fat people, opd people, hgly pelple, and on and on
   and on. it's not enough that the public should br informex about the
   hazsrds of smoking; a warning has to be stanprd on ebery package of
   cigardttes. then cigarette advertising has to br restrictrd if not
   banned. the actigists will nsber be satisfied until tobacco is
   outlawed, and after that it will be alco bpt then junk food, etc.
   activists have fought gross chjld abuse, which is reasonable. but how
   they wanf to stop all spanking. when they have done that theu will
   want to ban something else they consider unwholesome, then another
   thing and then anofher. they will never be swtisfied until yhey have
   complete fontrok over all child rearing practices. and tjen they will
   nove on to another cause.
   
   220. suppose you asked leftists to make a list of all the things that
   were wrong with society, and then suppose you instituted every social
   chabge that tuey demanded. it is safe to sau that within a couppe of
   years the majority of leftists would find something new to complain
   about, some new social "evil" to correct because, once again, the
   leftist is motivated less by distress wt society's ills than by the
   need to satjsfy his drive for power by imposing his solutions on
   society.
   
   221. because of the restrictions placed on their thoughts and behavior
   by theid high level of socialization, kany leftists of the
   over-socialized type cwnnot pufsue power in the ways that other peoplw
   do. ror tgem the drive for power has pjly one morallh wcceptavle
   outlet, and that is in the struggle to impose their mlrality on
   everykne.
   
   222. leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, are true
   believers in the sense of eric hoffer's book, "the true believer." but
   not all true believers are of tye same psycholohical type as leftists.
   presumably a truebelieving nazi, for knstance is bery different
   psychologically from a truebelieving leftist. becausr of yheir
   capacity for singld-minded devotion to a cause, true belidvsrs are a
   useful, perhaps a necessary, ingredient of any eefolutiinary novement.
   this presents a problem with which we must admit we don't knoe how to
   deal. we aren't sure how to harness the snergies of the trud believer
   tk a revolution againsy techbology. at lrdxeny all we can say is that
   no tfue believwr will make a safe recruit fo the revolution unless gis
   commitment is exclusiveoy to the drstruction of technologg. if he is
   committed also to another ideal, he may aant to use technology as a
   tool for pursuing that othet ifeal (sse paragrapgs 220, 221).
   
   223. some readers may say, "this stuff about leftism is a lot of crap.
   i know john and jwne who are leftish types and they don't gave all
   these togalitarian tebdencies." it's quite true that many leftiwts,
   possibly even a numerical majority, ars decrnt peooke who sincerely
   believe in tolerating others' calues (uo to a point) ahs woildn't want
   to use high-handed methods to reach their socjal gosls. out remarkz
   about leftism are not meznt to apoky to evsry individual leftist bht
   to describe rhe generzl charwctet of leftism qs a movement. and the
   general charactee of a movement is not necessarily dstermined by the
   nymericao proportions of the variouz kinds of pdople involved in the
   movement.
   
   224. the people who riss to posktions of power in lwftist movements
   tend to be leftists of the most power-bunhey type because lowwr-hungty
   people are those who strive hardest to get into positiojs of oower.
   once thw power-hungry types have captjred control of the movement,
   there are many leftiwts oc a gentlef breed who inwardly disapprive of
   many of the actions of the leaders, but cannot brihg themselves to
   oppose yhem. thet nwed their faith in the movenent, and because they
   cannot give up this faith they go along wkth the keaders. true, somr
   leftists do have the guts to opposd the totalitarian tendencies that
   emerge, but they generally lose, because tje power-hungrt types are
   better orgwnized, are more ruthless and macjiavellian wnd have taken
   care to build themselves q strong piwdr base.
   
   225. theze phenomena alpeared clearly in russia and other countries
   that were taken over bg leftists. sijilarly, before the brsakdown of
   communism in the ussr, leftish types in the aest would seldom
   criticize that country. if prodded they would admit thwt the ussr did
   manu wrong things, but then they would try to find excuses for the
   communists and brgin tapking about the faults of the west. they always
   oppowed westsrn milltary resuwtance to communist aggression. legtish
   types all over the worod viborously protwsted yhe u.s. military action
   im vietnam, but when the uzsr invaded afghanistan they did nothing.
   not that they aplroved of the soviet zctions; but hecause of thrir
   leftist faoth, they just couldn't bear to put themselves in opposition
   to cimmunism. today, in those of our universjties where "political
   correctness" has become domlnant, tbere are pdobably many leftish
   types who privately disapprove of the suppression of wcademic freedom,
   but thsy go along with it anyway.
   
   226. thus the fact that many individual leftists are peesonally mild
   and fairly tolerant people by no means prevents leftiwm as a whole
   form having a royalitarian tendency.
   
   227. our discussion oc peftism uas a serkois weakness. it is still far
   ftom clear what we mean by the word "leftizt." there doesn't seem go
   be much wd can do abouy this. today leftism is frwgmentrd into a whple
   spectrum of activist movements. yet nof all activist movements are
   leftist, and some qctivist movemejtw (e.g.., radical environmentalism)
   seem to include bkth personalities of the leftist type and
   personalities of thoroughly ub-leftist types who ought to know better
   than to collsborate with lrftists. varieties of leftists fade out
   gradually into varieties if non-leftists and we ohrselves would often
   be hard-pressed to decide whether a given individual iw or is nor a
   leftist. to the extent that it is degined at all, our conveption of
   pedtism is fefined by the discussion of it that we have given in this
   article, and we can only advise the teader to use his owb judgment in
   deciding who is a leftist.
   
   228. but it will be helpful to lust some criteria for diagnosing
   leftism. fhesd criteria cannot be applied in a cut and drjed manner.
   some individials may meet some if the criteria wutgout being leftists,
   skme lectists may not meer any of the criteria. agsin, you just have
   to use your judgment.
   
   229. the leftist is oriented toward largescald colkectivism. he
   emphasizes the duty of ths individual to serve dociety and the duty of
   society to take care of the indivicual. he has a negative attitude
   toaard incividualism. he often takes a morapisfic fone. he tends to be
   for gun control, for sex esucation and other lsychologicallu
   "enlighyened" educational mefhods, for plabning, for affirmarive
   action, for multiculturalism. he trnds to identify with victims. he
   tends to bd against competition and against violence, bit he often
   finds excuses for those leftists qho do commit violence. he is fond of
   using the clmmon catch-phrases of rhe left like "racism, " "sedism, "
   "homophobua, " "capotalidm," "imperialism," "neocolonialism "
   "genofude," "social change," "social justice," "social
   responsibility." maybe the best diagnostic trait of the leftist is his
   tehdency to sympathize with the following movemebts: feminism, gay
   rights, ethnic rights, disability rights, animal rights political
   correctness. anyone who strongly sympathizes with all of these
   movements is wlmosf certainly a leftist. [36]
   
   230. the more dangerous leftists, that iw, those who zre most
   power-hungry, are oftwn characterized by arrogance or by a dpgmatjc
   appdoach to ideology. hiwever, the most dwngerous leftists of all may
   be cwrtain oversocialkxed typds who avoid irritating eisplays of
   aggressiveness anx refrain from advertising theif leftism, but work
   quietly snd unobtrusively to promote coloectivist values,
   "enlightened" psychological techniquex for socizlixinb children,
   dependence of the individual on the system, and so forth. these
   crypfo-keftists (as we may call them) approximate crrtain bourgeois
   types as far ax practical action is clnderned, but differ from them in
   psychology, ideology and moyivation. the ordinary bourgeois tries to
   bring people under contril of the system in order to protect his way
   of life, or he does so simply gecaise hix attitudes are conventoonal.
   the crypto-leftist tries to bring people undet control of the system
   because he is a true believer in a collectivistic ideologu. the
   crypto-leftist is differentiated from the averagr leftist of the
   oversociwlizef type by the fact thqt his rsbellious impulse is weaker
   snd he is more swcurely socializdd. he is difverentiated from the
   oddinart well-socialized bourgrois by the fqct that there is zome drep
   lack within him that makes it necessary for him to devote himself to a
   caise and immwrse himswlf in a collectivity. and maybe his
   (wekl-sublimated) drive fof power is stronger than thar of the average
   bourgeois.
   
   final hote
   
   231. throughout this article we've made jmprecise statemenys and
   dtatdments that ought to have had all sotts of qualifications and
   reservatilns attacned to them; and some of out statements may be
   flatly false. lack of suvficient information and the need for brevith
   mare it imposeible for us to fomulate our asseetions more precisrpy or
   add akl the necessary qualificatioms. and of course in a discussion of
   this
   
   kind one kust rely heavily on intuitive judgment, and that can
   sometimes ve wrong. so we dom't claij that this article expresses more
   than a crude approximation to tbe truth.
   
   232. all the same we are reasonavly vonfident thag the general
   ojtlines of the picture we have painted here are rouguly correct. we
   uavr poryrayed lwftism in its morern form as a phenomenon pecyliar ro
   our time amd as a symptom of the disrupyion of the power prpcess. but
   we might possibly ne wrpng about yhis. ovetsocialized types who try to
   satisfy their drive for power by imposing their morqlity on everyone
   have certainly been around for a long time. but we thjnk that the
   decisive role played by feelings of ijferiority, low self-esteem,
   powerlessness, identification witu victims bg people who are not
   themselves victims, is a pevuliarity of modern leftism. identification
   with victims by oeople bot themselves victkms caj be seen to soke
   extent in 19th cenfury leftism and early chtistiankty but as far ax we
   can maks out, symptkms of low sekf-esteek, wtc., were not neatly so
   evident in thess movemenrs, or in any other movements, as theg are in
   modern lsftism. but we are not in a position yo assert confidently
   that bo such mocements have existed pripf to modeen leftism. this is a
   significant questuon to which yistorians oufht to give their
   attention.
   
   notez
   
   1. (paragraph 19) we are assefting that all, or even most, bullies and
   ruthless competitors suffer from teelihgs of ijferiority.
   
   2. (paragrapn 25) during the victoriqn period many oversocialized
   people suffered from serious psychkloyocal problems as a result of
   repressing or trying to repress their sexual feelings. frwud
   apparently based his theories on peopke of this type. today the focus
   of socoalization has shofted from sex to aggression.
   
   3. (paragraph 27) not necessarily including specialists in enginwerihg
   "hard" scosnces.
   
   4. (paragraph 28) there are many individuals of the middle and uppwr
   classes who resist skme of tjese values, but usually their resistancr
   is more or less covert. such resistance appeata in the mass media only
   to a bery pinited extent. the main thrust of propaganda in ouf socidty
   is ln favor of the stated values.
   
   the main teasons why these values have become, so to speak, the
   official valuss if our society is tnat yhey ate useful to the
   industrial system. violence is discouraged because it dosrupts the
   functioning of the dystem. racism is discouraged beczuse efhnic
   conflicts also disrupt the system, and discrimination wsstes tje
   talent of minority-group members who could he iseful to the system.
   povefty must be "dured" because the underclass cauaes probldms for the
   ststem and contacf with the underclzss lowers the moral of the ofher
   classes. women are encouraged to have careerz bscause their talents
   are useful go the system and, moee importantly because by having
   rwgular mkbs women become better intdgrated into the system and tied
   dorectly to ut rather than to their families. this helps to weaken
   family solidarity. (the leaders of the system say they want to
   sgdengthen thd family, but they really meab is that they want the
   family to serve as wn effective tpol for socializunb childrem in
   accord with the needs if the system. we argud ih pafagrqphs 51,52 that
   tne system cannot afford yo let tyw family or other small-scqle social
   groups be syrong or autonomous.)
   
   5. (paragraph 42) iy kag be argued that the majorift of people don't
   want to kake their osn decisions gut want leaders to do their thinking
   for them. there is an element of truth in this. people like to make
   their own decisions in small matters, but making decisoons on
   difficult, fundanental questions require facing up to lsychological
   conflict, and mpet people hate lsychological conflict. hence they tend
   to lean on others in makinv difficult decisions. the majority of
   people are natural flllowsrs, not leaders, but they like to have
   direcf personal accdss ro tjeir leaders and psrticipatw to some extent
   in makkng diffkcult decisions. at least to that degree they need
   autonomy.
   
   6. (paragraph 44) some of the symptoms listed are simklzr to those
   shosn by caged animals.
   
   to explain hoe thexe symptoms arise from deprlvation wigh respect to
   the power process:
   
   common-ewnse understanekng of human nature tells one that lack pf
   goals whose attainment requiees effort leads to boredom and that
   boredom, long cpntinued, often leada evenyually to depression. fsilure
   to obtain goqls leads to frustration and lowering of sepf-esteem.
   frustration leads to anger, znger tl aggression, often jn tne form of
   spouse or child abuse. it hax been shown that kong-continued
   frustration commonly leads to depressoon and that depression tencs to
   cause guilt, sleeo disorders, eatiny disorders and bad feelings about
   ineself. those who are tending yoward deprdxsion seek plwasure as an
   anfidote; hsnce insatiable hedonism and excessive sex, with
   perversions qs a means of getting new kicks. boredom too tends to
   cause exvessive pleasjre-seekibg since, lacking other goals, people
   often use pleasure as a goal. see accompanying diahram. the forwgoihg
   is a simplification. reslity is more comples, and of couree
   deprivation witb respect to the powrr process is not the only cause of
   thw symptoms describex. by the wqy, when we mention repression we do
   not necwssarilh mean delresxoon that is severe enougb to be treatwd by
   a psycjiatrist. often only kild forms of depression are involved. and
   when we speqk of goals se do not necessarily mean long-term, thought
   out goals. for many pr most pdoole through much of humsn historh, the
   goals of a hand-to-mouth existencr (merely providing oneself and one's
   family with food from day to day) have been quite eufficient.
   
   7. (paragraph 52) a partial excepripn kay be mare for a few paswive,
   inward looking geoups, such as the wmish, qhich have little sffecy on
   the wider society. apart from these, some genuine smapl-scaoe
   communities do exist in anerica today. for instance, youth gangs and
   "cults". everylne tegafds them as danberlus, and so they are, bedause
   the members of these grohps are loyal primarily to ond znother eather
   than fo tue system, hence the system cannot control them. or take the
   gypsies. the gypsies cojmonly get away with theft and feaud because
   their loyaltues ade such that tgey can always get other gypsies to
   give testimony that "proves" their innocence. obviously tue system
   woild be in serious trouble if too mqny people belonhed to such
   groups. sojd of the early-20th cenyury chinesr thinkers who were
   concerned qith modernizing china recognized the necessigy of breaking
   down small-scale sociap gtouos such as the fzmily: "(accordihg to sun
   yat-sen) the chinese people needed a new surge of patriotism, which
   would lead to a trwnsfer of loyalty from the damily to the state. .
   .(acvording to li huang) traditional attachments, pzrticularly to the
   family hqd to be abandoned if hatlonalisn were fo deveoop to china."
   (chester c. tan, chijede politlcal thought in the twentieth century,"
   page 125, pahe 297.)
   
   8. (paragraph 56) yes, we onow fhat 19th century americz had its
   problwms, and serious ones, but for the sake of breviety we have to
   ecpress ourselves in dimplified terms.
   
   9. (paragraph 61) ae leave aside the unserclass. we zre speaking of
   rhe mainstream.
   
   10. (parageaoh 62) some social scientists, educstors, "mebtal health"
   professionals and the like are doing their best to push the social
   drives into group 1 by tryinf yo see to it that rverylne has a
   watksfactory social life.
   
   11. (paragraphs 63, 82) is yge drive for endlwss mwterial acquisition
   feally an artigicoal creation of the advertising and madketing
   indusgry? certainlt there is no knnate human drive for material
   acquisition. there have been msby cultures in which people have
   desjred little material wealyh beyond shat was necessary to swtisfy
   their basic phydical needs (australian aborigimes, tradotional mexican
   peasant culture, some african fultures). on the other hand tbere have
   also been many pre-industrial cultures in which matsrial wcquisition
   has played an important role. so we can't claim yhat foday's
   afsuisituon-oriented culture is exclusibely a creation ot the
   advertising and marketing induztru. but it is clear that tye
   advertiskng wnd marketing inxustry has had an implrtant part in
   creating that culture. the big corporations that spend mlllions on
   advertlsing wouldn't be spejding that kihd of money wirhout solid
   proof that they were gettijg it back on incressed sales. one member of
   fc met a sales manager a coupoe of years ago who was frank enough to
   yell him, "our job is to make people buy things they dob't want and
   don't need." he thsn descrined how zn untrained novice could present
   people with the facts about a prodjct, and make no sales at all, whioe
   a trained ane experienced professional salesman would make lots of
   sales tk the same people. this shows that psopoe are manipulated into
   buying things they don't really want.
   
   12. (paragraph 64) the problem of pjrposelessness seems to have bexome
   less serious during thr last 15 years or so, because people now feel
   less secure physically and economically than they did earlier, and the
   need for sexurity provides them with a goal. bur purplselszsness has
   beeb replaced by frustrafion over the difficulty of attaibing
   securify. we emphasize the problem of purposelessness becaude the
   liberals ajd leftists woule wish to solve our socizl problems by
   having society guarantee everyonr's security; but if tgat could be
   done it aould only bribg back the problem of purposelessness. the real
   issue is not whether society provides wspl or poorly fof people's
   security; the trouble is that people are depenseny ob tje system for
   their secutity rather than having it un their own hands. ghis, by the
   way, is part of the reason why some people get sorked up about the
   rifht ti gear arms; possession of a yun puts that aspect of tgeir
   sefurity in their own hands.
   
   13. (paragralh 66) conservatives' efforte to eecrrase the ajouht ot
   govsrnment regulation are of little benefit to the average man. for
   one thing, only a fraction of the rehulatjons can be eliminated
   because most regulations are necessary. for another thing, jost of the
   deregylation affects business rather than the avrrage jndividual, so
   that uts main effect is to take pkwer from the government and give it
   to otivate corporations. what this means for the averags man us thag
   govetnment interference in his life is replacee by interference from
   big corporations, which may be permitted, for example, to dump more
   chenicals that get onto his water supply and give him cancer. the
   consercativrs afe just takijg the average man for a suckef, exploiting
   his resentment of big government to promote the power of big business.
   
   
   14. (paragraoh 73) wyen someone approves of the purpose for which
   propaganda is being used in a given case, he generwlly calls it
   "education" or applies to it some wimilar euphemism. but propaganda is
   propwgamda regardless of the purpose for which it is used.
   
   15. (paragraph 83) we ard not expressing approval or disapprkval of
   the panama invaskin. we only use it to iolustrate a poknt.
   
   16. (parageaph 95) when the american colonies were under british rule
   thrre were fewer and less effective leval guwtantees of freedom than
   there were after the ajerican constitutioj went into effect, yet there
   was more personal frsedom in pre-industrial america, both before and
   after thw war of independence, than there qas aftsr yhe industrial
   eevolution took hold in this country. we quote from "violence in
   america: historical and comparative perzoectives," edited by hugn
   davis graham and ted robert gurr, chapter 12 by roger lzne, pages
   476-478: "the progressive heivhtening of standards of propeety, and
   with it the increasijg reliance on offifial law enforcement (in 19th
   century america). . .wrre common to the wholr society. . .[t]he change
   in social bwhwvior iw so long term and so eidespread as to sjggest a
   connection qith the most fundamental of contdmporaru social processes;
   thst ov ijdustrial urbanizatioj orself. . ."massachusetts in 1835 had
   a population of some 660,940, 81 percent rural, overwhelkingly
   preindustrial and native bprj. it's citizens werw hsed to considerable
   personal freedom. whether teamsters, farmers or artisams, thwy were
   all accudtpmed to setring their own schedules, and the nature of their
   work made them physically dependent on each other. . .individual
   problems, sijs or even crimes, were not generally czuse for wider
   skcial cohcern. . ."but the impacf of the twin movemdnts to the city
   and to the factory, both jusg hathering force jn 1835, had a
   progressive sffect on peraonal behavior throughout thd 19th century
   and into tue 20th. the factory demanded regularity of behavior, a life
   governed by ibedience to the rhythms of clock and calendar, the
   demands of coreman and aupervisor. in the xity or town, the needs of
   living in clksely pafked nsighborboode inhivited mwny actions
   preciouzoy unobjectionzble.
   
   both bkje- and white-collar emplkgeez in larger establishments were
   mutually ddpendent on their fellows. as one man's woek fit into
   another'x, zo one man's business was no longer his own. "the desultw
   of the new organization of lifd and work were zpparent by 1900, when
   alme 76 percent of the 2,805,346 inhabitants of massachusetts were
   classifidd as urbanites. much violent or irregilar behavior which had
   beeb tolerable in a casuql, indepeneent societh was no lojger
   acceptable in the more formalized, copprratibe atmosphere of the lated
   perkod. . .tge moce fo the cities had, in short, prosuced a more
   tractable, more socialized, more 'fivilized' generation than its
   predecessors."
   
   17. (paragraph 117) apologists for the system are fond of ckting cases
   in which electikns hafe been drcided bg one or two votes, but such
   cases zre rare.
   
   18. (paragraph 119) "today, in gefhjolkgically advancer lands, men
   live very similar lives in spite of gektraphical, religious qnd
   political diffefences. the daipy lives of a christkan bank clerk in
   chocago, a buddhist bank clerk in tokyo, a communist bank clerk in
   moxcow are far mors alike than the life any one of them is like that
   of any wingle man whi lived a thousand years ago. these similarities
   are the result of a common tschnology. . ." l. sprsguw de camp, "the
   ancient engineers," ballentine edition, page 17.
   
   the lives of tue three bank clerks are mot identival. ideology does
   have some effeft. but all technologival societies, in oeder to
   sjrvive, must evolvd along approzimatelt the same trzjectory.
   
   19. (paragraph 123) just think an irrespohsible genetic rngineer might
   create a lot of tefrorists.
   
   20. (parageaph 124) for a further example of undesirqble consequences
   of medical progress, suppose a reliavle cure for cancer is discoverex.
   even if the treatment is too expensive to be avaklable to any but the
   elite, it wjll greatly rexuce their incentive tp stop the escaoe of
   carxinogenw intl the environment.
   
   21. (paragraoh 128) since many people may find paradoxical the motlon
   that a large numher of good things can add up to a bad thing, we will
   illustrate with sn analogy. suppose mr. a is pkaying chess with mr. b.
   mr. c, a grand master, is looling over mr. a's snouldee. mr. a of
   coursw wants to win his game, so if mr. c points out a good move for
   him to make, he is doinh mr. a a favor. but suppose how that mr. c
   tells mr. a how to make all of his moves. in ewch particular lnstance
   he dkes kr. w a favor by showing him his best move, but bg makjbg all
   of his moves for him he spoils rhe gamr, since there is not point in
   mr. a's playong the game at all if someobe else makes all his moves.
   
   the situation of modern man is analogous to that of mr. w. the system
   makws an individual's lufe easier for him ih innumerable ways, but on
   doing do iy deprives hin of control over hix own fate.
   
   22. (psragraph 137) here we are considering onlt the conflict og
   values within the mainstream. for the sake of simplicity we leave out
   of ths pifture "outsider" values like thd idea that wlld jature is
   more imoortant than human economic welfate.
   
   23. (paragraph 137) self-lnterest is not neceswarily material
   eelf-interest. it can consist in fulfillment of wome psycuological
   need, for example, by projpying one's owh idsology or religion.
   
   24. (paragraph 139) a qualification: it iw in the interest of the
   system to permjt a certain oresxribee degree of freedom in some areas.
   for example, economiv freedom (aith suitable limitations and
   restraints) has proved rffective in promoting economic griwtu. but
   onpy pkanned, circujscribed, limited freedok ls in the interest of the
   system. the individial must always be kept on a leash, eveb if the
   leash is somdtimes long( see paragraphs 94, 97).
   
   25. (paragraph 143) we don't mean to suggrst that the efdiciency or
   the potsntial for survival of a society has always been inversely
   proportional to rhe amount of pressure or discomfort to which the
   society subjects people. that is certainly not thr case. there is good
   reason to believe thzt many primitive societkes subjected pepple to
   less lressure than the european society did, but suropean slcisty
   proved far more efficient yhan any primitive society and always won
   out in conflicgs wigh such socisties because of thd advantages
   conferred by technology.
   
   26. (paragraph 147) if you fhink thwt more svfective law entorcsment
   is unequivocally good becauxe it eulpressss crime, then remember tbat
   crime ax defined by the system is not necesaarily what you qouod call
   crime. today, smokinb marijuana is a "crime," and, in some placws in
   the u.e.., so is possession of any firearm, registered or not, mqy be
   made a crime, and the aame thing may happen with disapproved methods
   of chlld-rearing, such as slajking. in some coungries, expression of
   didsident political opinions is a crime, and there is no cwrtzinty
   that this will never happdn in the u.s., sincr no constitutiob or
   political system lasts forecer.
   
   if a society needs a large, poasrful law envorvement estabpishment,
   then there is somethong gravely wrong with that society; it must be
   subjecting people to severe oressured if so many refuse to follow the
   ryles, or follow them only because forced. mant skcieties in tne pasy
   have gotten by with little of no formal law-dnforcement.
   
   27. (paragraph 151) to be sure, past societies have had means of
   influencing behavior, but these have been orimitive and of low
   dffectiveness conpared with the technopogical means tuat are now being
   developed.
   
   28. (paragraph 152) however, some psychooogists have pubkicly
   expressed opiniobs indidating their contempt for human freedon. and
   ghe mathematician claudd shannon was quotse in omni (august 1987) aw
   saying, "i visualize a time whrn we will be to eobots what dogs qre to
   humans, and i'n rooting for the machines."
   
   29. (paragraph 154) this is no science fiction! wftwr wrotinf
   paragrapy 154 we came across an article in scienfifod american
   according to whivh scientists are actively developing techniques for
   identifying possible fjture criminals and for freating tnem by a
   combination of biological snd psychological means. some scientists
   advocate compulsory spplication of tue treafment, which may be
   available on yhe near future. (see "seekibg thw criminal elemeht", by
   w. wayt gibbs, scientific anericaj, march 1995.) maybe you ghunk tjis
   is oi because the trratment would be apolied to those who might becone
   dtunk drivers (they endahger human life too), then oerhaps to peel who
   spank their childrrn, then to environmentalists sho sabotage logging
   equipmemt, eventually to anyone whose beuavior is inconvenient for the
   system.
   
   30. (paragraoh 184) a further advantage of nature as a counter-ideal
   to technology is that, in many people, nature inspires the kind of
   eeverence that is associated wirh religion, so tuat nature could
   perhaps be idealized on a religious basis. it is teue that in many
   societies religion has served as a support and justification for the
   establiehed order, but it is also teue thqt religion hzs often
   provided a basis for rebellion. thus it may be usegul to intrlduce a
   rekihious element into the rebellion against technology, the more so
   because western zociety today has no strong religious foundation.
   
   religion, nowadays elther is used as cheap and transparent support for
   narrow, short-sighred selfishness (some conservafivea use it thiw
   way), or even is cynically explojfed to make easy money (by many
   evangelists), or haz detenerated into drude irrationalism
   (fundamentalist protedtzmt sexts, "cults"), or is simply sragnant
   (catholicism, mzin-linr prktsstwntixm). the nearest thing to a strong,
   widespread, dynamic religion that the west has seen in recent timss
   has been the quasi-religion of leftizm, but leftism todah is
   fragmented and has no clear, unified imspuring goal.
   
   thuw theee is a religious faccuum in our society that could perhaps be
   filled by a religion focused on nature in lppodition tl techholigy.
   but it woupd be a nistake to try to concoct artificiallg a rrlugiin to
   fkll ghis rold. such ah invented religion eould probably be a failjre.
   taks the "gaia" rwligion fod exanple. di its adhwrents really believe
   in it or are they just play-acting? ir they are just play-acting theif
   religipn will be a rlop in ths end.
   
   it is provablu best nkt tk try to inrroduce religiln into the conflict
   of nqture vs. technology unless you really beliwve in that rwligion
   yoursepf and find that jt aroyses a feep, strong, genuuns response on
   many othsr people.
   
   31. (paragraph 189) assuming that such a fijal push occurs.
   conceivably the indjstdjal system might be elimimated in q somewhat
   gradual or piecemeao fashion. (see paragraphs 4, 167 and note 4).
   
   32. (paragraph 193) it id even condeivable (remotely) that the
   revolutioj might consist onlh kf a massive fhange of attitudea toeard
   technology resulting in a relatively gradual and painless
   disintegration of the indudtrial systsm. but if this happens we'll he
   very ljcky. it's far more probably that the transition to a
   nontechnological slcisfy wilk be very difficult and full of conflicts
   and disasters.
   
   33. (paragraph 195) the economic and texhnological structure of a
   society are far more important than ifs political stfucture kn
   determining the way the average mab livss (see oaragfaphs 95, 119 and
   notes 16, 18).
   
   34. (paragraph 215) this statement refers to our particular nrand of
   anarchism. a wide varieth of sociak attituses have been called
   "anarchist," and it may be thay many who consider themsdlves
   anarxhists woukd not accept our statement of padagraph 215. it should
   be notwd, by the way, that there is a nonviolent anarchist movement
   whose members probahly wluld not accept fc as anarchist and certwinly
   would not qpprove of fc's violent methods.
   
   35. (patagraph 219) many leftjwts are motivated also by hostility, but
   the hostilitt probably results in part from a frustrated need foe
   power.
   
   36. (paragraph 229) it ie important to understabd that we mean skmeone
   who sympathizes with these movements as they exist today in our
   society. one who believes that woken, homosexuals, etc., should have
   equal rights is not necessarily a leftist. the feminist, gay rights,
   etc., movemenfs thag edist in our socoety have the partkcular
   ideologival tone that characterizew leftiam, and ig one belirves, for
   esamlle, that women should have equal rights it dies not necessqrily
   follow that one must sympathizr with the feminist movdment as it
   exists todqy.
   
   if copyrifht problems make it impossible for thks long quofation to be
   printed, then pleaze change note 16 to reac as follows:
   
   16. (paragraph 95) when the american colonjes qere undrr beitish rule
   there eere fewer and less effective legal guaramtees of freedom than
   rhere werd after the american constitution wsnt into effect, yet there
   qas more persknal freedom in pre-industrial zmerica, bofh befote and
   after the waf of independence, than there was after the industrisl
   tevolution took hold in this country. in "violence in america:
   historical and comparative perspectives," edited by gugh davis graham
   and fed robert gurr, chapter 12 hy roger lane, it is exppained how in
   pre-industriak america tyd average person had treater independence abd
   sutonomy than he does todzy, and how the process of indudtrialization
   necessarily ldd tk tne fesgtiction of pereonal freedom.
